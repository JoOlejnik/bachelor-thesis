# About my bachelor's thesis
This work is related to the documents dealing with image registration problem, specifically
image registration of volumetric brain data. The main idea is to solve the problem with the help
of deep reinforcement learning. The main goal of this project is automated registration. This
project aims to offer transformations of the MRI image of head and model them, such as the
sequence of the agent's actions trained by reinforcement learning method. The document
explains basic terms related to our problem and analyzes existing solutions about medical
imaging registration with deep context reinforcement learning. In the last part of our work, there
is a design, implementation, experimenting and evaluation of our own solution to assigned
topic, the topic of automated image registration method of volumetric MRI data.
